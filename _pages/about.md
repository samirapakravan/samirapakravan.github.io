I’m a third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UCSB. I received my Master’s in computer science from New Mexico State University. My research interest is Scientific Machine Learning, which aims to combine classical machine learning techniques with the physical sciences. My recent work is focused on incorporating the knowledge that comes from solving a partial differential equation in training a neural network and ultimately solve an inverse problem.

Besides research, I enjoy teaching, especially fundamental courses in my field.
